			<h4>You Belong Here!</h4>
			<p>Look how far you've already come and all the amazing things you've accomplished.</p>

			<p>Great things are done by a series of small things together... the only time you should ever look back is to see just how far you've come. And you've come so far!!</p>

			<h4>Be somebody nobody thought you could be!</h4>
			<p>Growth is painful, change is painful. But nothing is as painful as staying stuck somewhere you don't belong.</p>

			<p>You're a skillcrusher now!! Be thankful for the struggle because without it you wouldn't have found your strength. Keep going Skillcrusher! You've got this.</p>
